A game for 

Install
=======
If you only want to run the game, then you need to install the _base_
requirements. You can do this using:

    pip install -r requirements/base.txt

If you want to work on the game, then you need all of the _development_
requirements. You can install these using:

    pip install -r requirements/devel.txt

If you have no clue what either of these mean, check the [long
installation][install].
